The module takes advantage of the economies of scale offered by DC networks over individual cooling systems, making it particularly beneficial for areas with high cooling demands.</p> <p>DC networks typically center around high-demand zones, such as hospitals, office buildings, and grocery stores. Considering this, the module identifies specific locations within a city (LAU2 region) where such high-demand sites coincide. These points, referred to as \"anchor points,\" are potential centers for DC networks. Areas around these anchor points, possibly high residential zones, could benefit from lower cooling costs due to the economies of scale achieved by connecting to a DC network, even when including the costs of grid construction.</p> <p>The feasibility of district cooling in these areas is assessed using the levelized cost of district cooling, which incorporates grid costs, pumping costs, and the costs of the cooling source. The calculation takes into account the total demand for cooling, the potential coverage of the DC network, and the costs associated with construction and operation. Comparing the levelized costs of district cooling against the levelized cost of cooling from the individual supply, the calculation module identifies feasible areas for district cooling. Additionally, it evaluates the average pipe diameters per cell and the total network length per identified region.

In case of CSV files, makes sure that you keep all the columns, column separator, and data types as of the downloaded sample. We suggest to open CSV files in text editor rather than MS Excel in order to see all characters inside it. Regarding the upload of raster files, following aspects should be considered:</p> <ul> <li>The raster should have the coordinate reference system of ETRS89-extended / LAEA Europe - EPSG:3035;</li> <li>The coordinate of the raster origin (top-left corner of the raster) should be a multiplicand of 100, e.g. (4334900, 3019700);</li> <li>The resolution of the raster map should be 100x100m;</li> <li>The raster should refer to a location in Europe.</li> <li>pay attention to the units of the original data set shown on the toolbox.

Such units could be waste incineration, biomass-fired combined heat and power plants or excess heat from industrial processes. The tool includes these by adding a production from these units as group before using the option of heat pumps or electric boilers for every hour. Meaning that the larger the share is of these, the less possibility for flexibility there is in the district heating system. The default value is 50%, meaning by default half of the district heating supply will be from non-electric units. If only heat pumps and electric boilers are used the share should be set to 0%. </p> <p>It is possible to define how this share should be understood hour by hour by choosing a distribution in the Inputs section. Using \u201cStandard\u201d distribution means that the production of the non-electric units is simply divided equally out in each hour of the simulated year. The \u201cCM \u2013 District Heating Supply\u201d can be used to identify how much heating is expected to be supplied from non-electric units.</p> <p>District heating storage capacity</p> <p>Heat storage capacity in the district heating system, in average days of storage. An average day is here based on district heating production on an average day, which is found based on the yearly district heating production. So, for example, if \u201cEnd-use heating demand supplied by district heating\u201d is 10 GWh/year and the \u201cGrid loss for district heating\u201d is 20%, then the yearly district heating production would be 12.5 GWh meaning an average day would have a demand of 34.15 MWh (12.5 GWh per year / 365 days = 34.15 MWh/day).

The reference scenario is based on energy statistical data from 2022. For simplicity and to show the principles of the CM, we here assume that all electricity is imported in the reference scenario. The following energy demands are included: * Traditional electricity consumption (incl. industries). We insert this under \u201cInflexible electricity demand\u201d (0.5 TWh/yr) * Electricity consumption for individual heating. Here we assume all is direct electric heating, so we insert this under \u201cShare of heating demand using direct electric heating\u201d (0.009 TWh/yr) * District heating production. We insert the end-user demand under \u201cEnd-user heating demand supplied by district heating\u201d (0.251 TWh/yr). We here assume that all district heating is supply by non-electric driven units and therefore set \u201cShare of district heating from non-electric units\u201d to 100%.  * Electricity consumption for transport. We assume that 6200 EVs are in the area, so we insert this under \u201cNumber of EVs.</p> <p>We keep the rest as default values. We then run the CM and se the following:</p> <p></p> <p>After seeing how the system is behaving, we can try to add different technologies to see how that affects the results. We will try two different scenarios. </p> <p>Scenario 1 \u2013 Adding Wind and PV</p> <p>This scenario adds wind power and PV to the electricity production. The following capacities were identified using other CMs to calculate potential in the area, and are added to the reference model: * Wind power: 48 MW (Wind power capacity installed) * PV: 57 MW (PV capacity installed)</p> <p>We then run the CM and get the following results. </p> <p> </p> <p>So interestingly the electricity production from these capacities of wind power and PV only partially covers the demand. With PV contributing mostly in the summer, and wind power mostly in the winter. This indicates that significant more PV and wind power capacity is needed if we want to supply to the local demands and might mean that surrounding areas are needed to supply electricity to this area. Also interestingly is that the EV charging peak increased from 7 MW in the reference scenario to 30 MW in this scenario. This is done as EnergyPLAN identified the possibility to utilize more local renewables by charging the EVs more flexible. More on the working on EnergyPLAN can be found here: https://energyplan.eu/about-energyplan/</p> <p>Scenario 2 \u2013 Electric Heat Pumps for DH</p> <p>We will then try to change the district heating supply. We want to investigate what happens if the district heating supply is changed to only using electric heat pumps. We build this on Scenario 1, meaning that wind power and PV capacities remain the same as in Scenario 1. We are making the following changes: -   Heat pump electric capacity: From 0 MW to 30 MW -   Share of DH from non-electric units: From 100% to 0%</p> <p>We then run the CM and get the following results. </p> <p> </p> <p>So, we see that changing the district heating supply to heat pumps especially increases the electricity demand in the winter months. The peak for EV charging goes back down to 7 MW as in the reference scenario, as the heat pumps for district heating now are the preferred flexibility option of EnergyPLAN, that it uses to utilize as much locally produced electricity as possible. </p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"energy-system-cm-energyplan-cm/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>https://energyplan.eu/ </li> <li>https://energyplan.eu/case-studies/ </li> <li>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segy.2021.100007</li> <li>https://www.seenergies.eu/</li> <li>https://heatroadmap.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/STRATEGO-WP2-Background-Report-2-Hourly-Distributions-1.pdf </li> <li>https://energyplan.eu/case-studies/heat-roadmap-europe-4-hre4/ </li> <li>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112777</li> </ul> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"energy-system-cm-energyplan-cm/#how-to-cite","title":"How To Cite","text":"<p>Peter Sorkn\u00e6s, Alisson Aparecido Vitoriano Julio and Aksel Bang, in citiwatts Wiki, EnergyPLAN CM Page (August/September 2025)</p>"},{"location":"energy-system-cm-energyplan-cm/#authors-and-reviewers","title":"Authors And Reviewers","text":"<p>Peter Sorkn\u00e6s, Alisson Aparecido Vitoriano Julio and Aksel Bang, Aalborg University</p>"},{"location":"energy-system-cm-energyplan-cm/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>Copyright \u00a9 2022-2025: OpenGIS4ET / citiwatts team</p> <p>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</p> <p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 International License.</p> <p>SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0</p> <p>License-Text: https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html</p>"},{"location":"energy-system-cm-energyplan-cm/#acknowledgement","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>The project \u201cOpen Geographic Information System for Energy Transition\u201d (OpenGIS4ET, Project Number 111 786) has been supported by partners of the ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems and Mission Innovation through the Joint Call 2020.

For example, the implementation of district heating in areas with low heat demand is not economically viable. On the other hand, defining any area with high heat demand density as a potential DH area can also be inaccurate. A high heat demand density in an area could be due to the presence of a few consumers with a very high heat demand within that area. On the contrary, a low average heat demand density could be a sign of zones with a very low heat demand within the selected area. The aim of the calculation module \"CM - DISTRICT HEATING POTENTIAL AREA: USER-DEFINED THRESHOLD\" is to provide a reasonable balance between heat demand density in an area and its constituting zones.</p> <p>The \"CM - DISTRICT HEATING POTENTIAL AREA: USER-DEFINED THRESHOLD\" determines the DH areas and their corresponding DH potential based on heat demand densities. The heat demand densities are obtained from an input GIS layer. The Hotmaps toolbox and database provides a default heat density map that can be used in this calculation module. The Hotmaps heat density map is in raster format and has a resolution of one hectare and Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of \"ETRS89 / LAEA Europe - EPSG 3035\". The cells in the map show the heat densities in MWh/ha. Besides this default map also maps generated by the user can be uploaded to the toolbox and used in this CM.</p> <p>As output, one GIS layer, three indicators and two diagrams are presented. These outputs are explained in detail in the section Sample Run. The output layer demonstrates the potential DH areas. By clicking on each area on the map, a window pops up and the DH potential corresponding to that area is shown. Within the INDICATORS / GRAPHICS windows in the RESULTS section of the toolbox, relevant indicators and charts regarding DH potential within the selected zone and potentials in sub-zones are illustrated.</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"heat-cm-district-heating-potential-areas-user-defined-thresholds/#inputs-and-outputs","title":"Inputs And Outputs","text":"<p>The input parameters and layers, as well as output layers and parameters, are as follows.</p> <p>Input layers and parameters are:</p> <ul> <li>Minimum heat demand in each hectare [MWh/ha/a]: a value between 0.1 and  10000000</li> <li>Minimum heat demand in a DH area [GWh/year]: a value between 0.1 and  10000000</li> <li> <p>Heat density map: a default map is provided in the toolbox; own uploaded maps can also be used in the CM</p> </li> <li> <p>in raster format (*.tif)</p> </li> <li>with 1-hectare resolution</li> <li>CRS of EPSG:3035</li> <li>demand densities in MWh/ha</li> </ul> <p>Output layers and parameters are:</p> <ul> <li>DH areas in raster and shapefile formats</li> <li>DH potential in each DH area [GWh/year]</li> <li>Total heat demand in GWh within the selected zone</li> <li>Total district heating potential in GWh within the selected zone</li> <li>Potential share of district heating from total demand in selected zone</li> </ul> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"heat-cm-district-heating-potential-areas-user-defined-thresholds/#method","title":"Method","text":"<p>The potential for DH in a specific region can be defined by the overall heat demand and its spatial allocation. In the Hotmaps toolbox, the heat demand is represented in the form of a raster map. In order to properly define potential DH areas, both the heat demand in each cell and also in an area should reach a certain level. As a starting point, the Hotmaps toolbox suggests default values for these two parameters. However, depending on the distribution of heat demand and also the local conditions, the Hotmaps user can modify these values.</p> <p>The determination of DH areas is done in two steps:</p> <p>In the first step, all the cells with heat demand below the input parameter \"Minimum heat demand in hectare\" are filtered. By eliminating these cells from the map, we obtain groups of cells that are attached to each other. Each set of these attached cells constitute small zones that here, are referred to as \u201ccoherent areas\u201d. In the second steps, the total heat demand in each coherent area is calculated. For each coherent area, if the total heat demand is higher than the input parameter \"Minimum heat demand in a DH area\", it is considered as a potential DH area.</p> <p>Finally, for the DH areas, the potential is calculated and presented in the form of a GIS layer, which can be seen in the toolbox.</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"heat-cm-district-heating-potential-areas-user-defined-thresholds/#github-repository-of-this-calculation-module","title":"GitHub Repository Of This Calculation Module","text":"<p>Here you get the bleeding-edge development for this calculation module.</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"heat-cm-district-heating-potential-areas-user-defined-thresholds/#sample-run","title":"Sample Run","text":"<p>To run the calculation module, follow the next steps:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First, use the \"Go To Place\" bar to navigate to Aalborg and select the city.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click on the \"CALCULATION MODULES\" tab.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click on the \"CM-DISTRICT HEATING POTENTIAL AREAS: USER-DEFINED THRESHOLDS\" button.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The default input values show the general conditions under which an area can be considered as a potential DH area.

Investment\u00a0+\u00a0dispatch: simultaneously selects new capacity additions and their dispatch - Hourly resolution for detailed insights into load matching, temperature constraints, and electricity\u2011price interactions - Multi\u2011technology support (CHP, boilers, heat pumps, waste\u2011to\u2011energy, solar thermal, excess heat) - Customisable parameters covering CAPEX/OPEX, efficiencies, lifetimes, CO\u2082 price, interest rate, and grid temperature limits</p> <p>Primary Outputs: * Optimal dispatch schedules and (if enabled) capacity expansions * Levelized Cost of Heat (LCOH) and full annual cost breakdown (investment annuity, O&amp;M, fuel, CO\u2082, ramping) * Annual generation volumes (thermal and electrical) and CO\u2082 emissions * Technology share in both investment and dispatch</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"heat-cm-district-heating-supply/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The District Heating Supply calculation module (CM) evaluates how best to meet a region\u2019s district heating (DH) needs using a portfolio of supply technologies, ranging from boilers and heat pumps to CHP, waste\u2011to\u2011energy, solar thermal, and excess heat.</p> <p>In dispatch mode, the module takes pre\u2011installed capacities and solves an hourly linear optimisation to minimise operating costs (including fuel, electricity, and CO\u2082 costs) while respecting network temperature constraints.</p> <p>In investment\u00a0+\u00a0dispatch mode, the model simultaneously determines optimal capacity expansions and dispatch schedules to cover the annual load at lowest total cost.

Originally initiated by the Hotmaps project (hotmaps-project.eu), the open repository is hosted on GitLab and has provided a structured framework for storing, documenting, and sharing spatial data layers relevant to energy system planning at local and regional scales.</p> <p>As part of the citiwatts project, the repository has been expanded with new data layers and an evolving pipeline that enables streamlined integration of additional datasets. Each dataset is released with comprehensive metadata, technical documentation, and a data descriptor, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and interoperability. The project adheres to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), promoting responsible data management and long-term usability. Selected datasets produced within citiwatts are also archived and assigned persistent identifiers via Zenodo, ensuring durable access and citation. Some examples include Zenodo Record 13683085 and Zenodo Record 7876126.</p> <p>In addition to the data layers, the calculation modules (CMs) developed during citiwatts are also preserved through Software Heritage, ensuring long-term availability and traceability. These modules are accompanied by their own metadata and documentation, allowing users to understand and replicate the methods used in energy planning workflows.</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"open-data-repository/#final-remarks","title":"Final remarks","text":""},{"location":"open-data-repository/#how-to-cite","title":"How To Cite","text":"<p>OpenGIS4ET Team, in citiwatts Wiki, Heat Planning page in the Learning Center section (August/September 2025)</p>"},{"location":"open-data-repository/#authors-and-reviewers","title":"Authors And Reviewers","text":"<p>Alejandro Pena-Bello - HES-SO VS - alejandro.penabello@hevs.ch</p>"},{"location":"open-data-repository/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>Copyright \u00a9 2016-2025: OpenGIS4ET/citiwatts and Hotmaps teams</p> <p>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</p> <p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 International License.</p> <p>SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0</p> <p>License-Text: https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html</p>"},{"location":"open-data-repository/#acknowledgement","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>The authors would like to convey their deepest appreciation to the ERA-Net OpenGIS4ET Project financed, for the Swiss partners, by the Swiss Federal Office for Energy.</p> <p>The project \u201cOpen Geographic Information System for Energy Transition\u201d (OpenGIS4ET, Project Number 111 786) has been supported by partners of the ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems and Mission Innovation through the Joint Call 2020.
